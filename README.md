# search_by_date

The ultimate "why it's not built-in" app. Allows you to customize search results by date. On the fly.

There are 4 ways to specify a date:

1. Date range - date:mm/dd/yyyy-mm/dd/yyyy
2. One day* - date:mm/dd/yyyy-mm/dd/yyyy
3. From (date)** - date:mm/dd/yyyy
4. Up to (date) - date:-mm/dd/yyyy

Don't use spaces. Hereafter for this information you can reference a popup (by pushing on a little icon in the top right corner).

*By typing a date twice
**You can also use this option if searching for today's results
